A template project that uses the Wear OS Data Layer API to send custom classes from the phone to the watch and back.
This project was created as the base for Wear OS intergration into my task manager so I have included some related elements I found necesary for my classes to work with the api

Please note that both the watch and mobile will need to be singed into google play for the Data Layer API to work as expected. 
Updating all apps on either device is also recomended to ensure correct preformance of the project. Go to the Google Play app -> Manage Apps -> Update all.
